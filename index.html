                <img src="/img/test.jpeg" alt="test_team"/>
                <p>Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket and is considered its highest standard. Test matches are played between national representative teams with "Test status", as determined and conferred by the ICC. The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days or longer. It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance. The name Test stems from the long, gruelling match being both mentally and physically testing. The first officially recognised Test match took place on 15–19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), where Australia won by 45 runs. A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was held in Melbourne on 12–17 March 1977, in which Australia beat England by 45 runs—the same margin as that first Test.</p>

                <img src="/img/odi.jpeg" alt="odi_team"/>
                <p>A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to T20 matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. The international one-day game is a late-twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one-day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball.</p>

                <article class="heading">twenty 20</article>
                <img src="/img/t20.jpg" alt="twenty20"/>
                <p>Twenty20 cricket and often abbreviated to T20, is a short form of cricket. At the professional level, it was originally introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition in England and Wales. In a T20 game the two teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to 20 overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, T20 is one of the 3 forms of cricket recognised by the ICC as being at the highest international or domestic level. A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three hours, with each innings lasting around 90 minutes and an official 10 minute break between the innings. This is much shorter than previously-existing forms of the game, and is closer to the timespan of other popular team sports. It was introduced to create a fast-paced form of the game which would be attractive to spectators at the ground and viewers on television.</p>
